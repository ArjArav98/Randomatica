I guess I have a strange aversion to creating brand new repositories for small projects. Seems like a waste of a repository. Anyways, these are libraries for personal projects which are either too small for having a repository of their own.

I'm writing the projects as libraries so that anyone can use them in their own projects. And yes, **no packages** or **pre-defined libraries** shall be used here!

### Cryptography

#### Cryptonite (C)
This is a library which lets users implement various symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems to encode text. It also includes other functions which do other important tasks such as key generation (for both private-key and public-key cryptography).
* Key Generation (Symmetric/Private-Key Cryptography)
* Key Generation (Asymmetric/Public-Key Cryptography)

## Future Ideas
* JSON Serialiser and Deserialiser from Scratch
* Othello/Reversi Simulation
