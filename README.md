I guess I have a strange aversion to creating brand new repositories for small projects. Seems like a waste of a repository....I don't know. Anyways, these are libraries for personal projects which are either too small for having a repository of their own or are just plain silly.

I'm writing the projects as libraries so that anyone can use them in their own projects. And yes, no packages or pre-defined libraries shall be used here! 

The libraries are categorised according to domain.
