I guess I have a strange aversion to creating brand new repositories for small projects. Seems like a waste of a repository. Anyways, these are libraries for personal projects which are either too small for having a repository of their own.

I'm writing the projects as libraries so that anyone can use them in their own projects. And yes, **no packages** or **pre-defined libraries** shall be used here!

### Cryptography

#### Cryptonite (Golang and C)
Cryptonite is a package written in Golang (and a bit in C) which lets users to encrypt and decrypt text using symmetric and assymetric forms of encryption and decryption. The package also allows users to generate keys (both for symmetric and assymetric cryptography).

## Future Ideas
* JSON Serialiser and Deserialiser from Scratch
* Othello/Reversi Simulation
