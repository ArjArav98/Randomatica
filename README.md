### JavaScript
#### JSON Serialiser and Deserialiser
A collection of functions which help to convert a JSON document into a Javascript object and the reverse. Coded from scratch in Javascript. Yeah, I know it's already there as a library function but it's fun to DIY.

#### Othello/Reversi
A implementation of the Othello/Reversi game in Node.js.
